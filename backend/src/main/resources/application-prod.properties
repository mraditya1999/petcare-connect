# PRODUCTION-SPECIFIC SPRING BOOT PROPERTIES
# ===============================================
# This file contains overrides for the main 'application.properties' file
# and will be used when the 'prod' Spring profile is active.

# --- JPA / Hibernate ---
# Disable verbose SQL logging in production to improve performance and reduce log noise.
# Schema management is handled by Liquibase ('spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none' in the base config).
spring.jpa.show-sql=false

# --- Thymeleaf Templating Engine ---
# Enable template caching in production for a significant performance boost.
# Templates will be compiled once and reused, instead of being reparsed on every request.
spring.thymeleaf.cache=true

# --- Logging Configuration ---
# Set the default (root) logging level to INFO for production.
# This provides a good balance of useful information without excessive verbosity.
logging.level.root=INFO

# Set specific levels for key packages to INFO to keep logs clean.
# DEBUG and TRACE levels should be avoided in production unless actively debugging an issue.
logging.level.org.springframework.web=INFO
logging.level.org.springframework.security=INFO
logging.level.com.petconnect.backend=INFO
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=INFO
