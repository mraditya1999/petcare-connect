## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm (>=6.x)
- Docker (if planning to use Docker for containerization)

## Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
\`\`\`

Next, install the dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

## Development

To start the development server, run:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Build

To create a production build of the app, run:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

The build will be located in the `build` directory.

## Docker

You can also use Docker to containerize your application.

### Build Docker Image

To build the Docker image, use the following command:

\`\`\`bash
docker build -t yourproject:latest .
\`\`\`

### Run Docker Container

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

\`\`\`bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 yourproject:latest
\`\`\`

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project:

\`\`\`yaml
version: '3'
services:
frontend:
build: .
ports: - "3000:3000"
environment: - NODE_ENV=development
\`\`\`

To start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`, run:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up
\`\`\`
